## July 2023

### Author: Mihlali Kota

## Overview

Welcome to the Book Connect JavaScript Code Review and Improvement Project! In my role as a junior JavaScript developer, I've had the privilege of collaborating with the Book Connect startup on their social media platform designed for book enthusiasts. While the HTML and CSS segments garnered positive attention, the JavaScript code was in need of refinement. My objective was to perform an extensive code review, rectify critical issues, and elevate aspects such as performance, readability, and maintainability.

## Project Goals

As part of this project, I embarked on a mission to achieve the following goals:

1. **View a List of Book Previews (Title and Author):**

   - Conducted an assessment of the current code to ensure the successful display of book previews, inclusive of titles and authors.
   - Ensured that the presentation of the list was formatted impeccably, promoting readability.

2. **Display an Image for Each Book Preview:**

   - Verified the integration of images within each book preview, paying careful attention to accurate linkage and proper display.

3. **Option to Read Book Summary:**

   - Ensured that users had the option to access book summaries, with the implementation of a toggle mechanism to seamlessly show or hide the summary as needed.

4. **Display Book Publication Date:**

   - Verified the inclusion of book publication dates alongside their respective previews, introducing this feature where lacking.

5. **Search Books by Text Phrases:**

   - Confirmed the existence of a search functionality enabling users to explore books based on specific text phrases, implementing it where required.

6. **Filter Books by Author:**

   - Evaluated the code for the availability of author-based book filtering, enhancing this feature if not already present.

7. **Filter Books by Genre:**

   - Ensured a mechanism for users to conveniently filter books by genre, introducing this option if not previously accessible.

8. **Toggle Dark and Light Modes:**
   - Investigated the app's user interface to ascertain the presence of both dark and light mode options, introducing a seamless toggle functionality for mode switching.

## Bugs and Solutions

Throughout the project, I encountered a range of bugs in the existing code. Here are some of the issues I identified and the corresponding solutions I implemented:

**Bugs:**

- Syntax errors, undefined variables, and incorrect loop syntax.
- Inconsistent variable declarations and improper function declarations/calls.
- Incorrect assignments to HTML elements and incorrect event handler syntax.
- Incorrect use of object methods, flawed filtering and search logic.
- Misuse of the `Date()` function for date manipulation.

**Solutions:**

- Corrected data population for genres and authors.
- Enhanced logic for book filtering and searching.
- Implemented a detailed book overlay.
- Successfully applied the selected theme to the application.
- Improved functionality of the "Show more" button.
- Ensured proper initialization of the homepage.
- Refined the behavior of search and settings overlays.
- Implemented a "No results found" message for narrow filters.

## Wrapping Up

This project has been an incredible learning journey, and I'm excited to share my findings and enhancements with the team. The Book Connect platform is now more robust, user-friendly, and in line with our goals. For a more detailed technical dive, feel free to explore the codebase and accompanying presentation. Thank you all for your support throughout this endeavor!
